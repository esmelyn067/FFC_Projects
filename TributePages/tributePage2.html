      <h3 id="about">About Stan Lee</h3><article class="conten">
      <p><strong>Stan Lee</strong>, the legendary writer, editor and publisher of <strong>Marvel Comics</strong> whose fantabulous but flawed creations made him a real-life superhero to comic book lovers everywhere, began in the business in 1939 and created or co-created <strong>Black Panther, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Daredevil and Ant-Man</strong>,  among countless other characters.</p>
     
      <p>On his own and through his work with frequent artist-writer collaborators <strong>Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko</strong> and others, Lee catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world's No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant.His way of doing things at Marvel was to brainstorm a story with an artist, then write a synopsis. After the artist drew the story panels, Lee filled in the word balloons and captions.</p>
      
      <p>Lee's fame and influence as the face and figurehead of Marvel, even in his nonagenarian years, remained considerable.</p></article>

            "Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created.A superhero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart."
